Machine Assembly Final Notes:


Ch. 6  - Floating Point:

IEEE 754 - Single Precision Floating Point
Float datatype i.e. 32-bit "encoded value"
Like a binary scientific notation.



Regular Decimal Quantity:

123.256   convert to Normalized Scientific Notation:

Move decimal to left 2 positions:

1.23256

Multiply by 10

1.23256 x 10^2



Now, we have a fractional value to begin with:

0.00789

Move decimal to right 3 positions

7.89x10^-3




Binary Fractional Values:

Convert 0.75 (base 10) to binary:

Use repeated multiplication

0.75 x 2 = 1.5    1 is MSB   5 repeatedly fractional part by 2

0.5 x 2 = 1.0    1 is LSB    0 STOP when fractional part == 0

So 0.75   is   0.11 (base 2)




Example 2:

0.875   to   binary

0.875 x 2 = 1.75    1 is the MSB

0.75 x 2 = 1.5

0.5 x 2 = 1.0      1 is the LSB


0.875 (base 10)  = 0.111 (base 2)







FP32 Encoding

bit 31  is the S field

* S: Sign Field

S = 0  is positive
S = 1  is negative



30 to 23   is the E field

E: Biased Exponent Field

* E = bias + P
bias = 127
p = unbiased exponent



22 to 0   is the F field

* F: Fraction (Also called Mantissa or Significand)

All bits to the right of radix point of the normalized
binary quantity.
